# What is it?

A pure Rust/WebGL jigsaw puzzle for browsers (desktop-only, for now).

Powered by [Shipyard ECS](https://github.com/leudz/shipyard). 

Puzzle pieces generated via [piecemaker](https://github.com/jkenlooper/piecemaker). 

Some other stuff under the hood ([awsm-web](https://github.com/dakom/awsm-web), [shipyard-scenegraph](https://github.com/dakom/shipyard-scenegraph), etc.)

# Status

Still more to do:

* Sound effects
* Multiplayer
* Toggle outline mode (maybe)
